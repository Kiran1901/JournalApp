As our everyday life revolves around various activities that makes great memories we want to remember, writing physically all the information seems old school and also hard to search again when we need it again. Also we make everyday expense diary to track our expenses and mange our needs and budget. It is very tiresome process of calculating all expenses for specific time period and lacks insight about absolute flows of money.

We all want this process to be as easy texting a message. So we have designed an application which handles all the worries about maintaining all the memories, all your expenses and also who owes you how much. You can edit and insert new entries any time. It also provides mailing service to send mails to people who owe you money. This is not just it, our app provides the insights we want from our transaction, letâ€™s say you want all your expenses from date 2nd sept to 15th October, you got it in the graphical form and also total of it just with the click of the button. Is that seems as easy as texting ?
